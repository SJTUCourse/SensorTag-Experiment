Provide several real pictures of your SensorTag and identify all the chips of sensors in the pictures.  \r\nYou can find the following model pictures [here](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/tearDown.html).\r\n![SensorTag-back](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/images/sensorTag-teardown-bluetooth-03.jpg)\r\n![SensorTag-front](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/images/sensorTag-teardown-bluetooth-04.jpg)\r\n2.  Describe the function and name of the sensor chip you used. You can find the information of the related sensors [here](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/tearDown.html).  \r\n3.  Select an application for the sensor you used. Summary the description, results and potential development plan of your application in a final report, and 1 and 2 as well. \r\n\r\n  > i.e., I used the sensor of [TMP007](http://www.ti.com/product/tmp007) to measure the enviroment temperature in the Minhang campus of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  \r\n\r\n## FAQs\r\nTBD  \r\n## Helpful resources\r\n* [Simplelink SensorTag](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015)\r\n* [TI E2E Community for Bluetooth Smart](http://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless_connectivity/f/538)\r\n* [IBM IoT Foundation service](https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/device/95096397e1ea/sensor/)\r\n* [IBM Bluemix Doc](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs)\r\n * [Internet of Things Starter](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/IoT/iot500.html)\r\n * [SDK for Node.js](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/nodejs/index.html#nodejs)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
