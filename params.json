Provide several real pictures of your SensorTag and identify all the chips of sensors in the pictures.  \r\nYou can find the following model pictures [here](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/tearDown.html).\r\n![SensorTag-back](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/images/sensorTag-teardown-bluetooth-03.jpg)\r\n![SensorTag-front](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/images/sensorTag-teardown-bluetooth-04.jpg)\r\n2.  Describe the function and name of the sensor chip you used. You can find the information of the related sensors [here](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/tearDown.html).  \r\n3.  Select an application for the sensor you used. Summary the description, results and potential development plan of your application in a final report, and 1 and 2 as well. \r\n\r\n  > i.e., I used the sensor of [TMP007](http://www.ti.com/product/tmp007) to measure the enviroment temperature in the Minhang campus of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  \r\n\r\n## FAQs\r\nQ: I have a SensorTag around, how can I get started to view the sensor data?  \r\nA: If you are an iOS user, this [article](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/find-your-sensortag-device-id-in-ios/) provides detailed descriptions. If you are an android user, similar operations should be performed.\r\n\r\nQ: I want to fetch the sensor data from [IBM IoT Cloud](https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/device/), how can I achieve that in my computer?  \r\nA: You should do the following steps,  \r\n(1) Ensure that your SensorTag with 'Push to cloud' turned on in 'Cloud View'.  \r\nIf you do not have a SensorTag around, you can use your computer to simulate as SensorTag, and this [article](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/use-the-simulated-device-to-experience-the-iot-foundation/) provides detailed descriptions.  \r\n\r\n(2) Install IBM Python SDK for IoT in your computer.\r\n* [Python 2.7/3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads)\r\n* Upgrade [pip](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)  \r\nDownload the get-pip.py and run in command lines: python get-pip.py  \r\n* [IoT Python](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/iot-python)  \r\nIf you are not familiar with Python language, [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) can help you exercise Python programming so that you can master Python quickly, maybe in three days or a week.  \r\n\r\n(3) Get DeviceID of your SensorTag, run in the command lines as below,  \r\n> python simpleApp.py -I deviceID  \r\n\r\nQ: How to deploy my application in [IBM Bluemix](https://www.ng.bluemix.net)?  \r\nA: [Register](https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/getting_started/register/index.html)  \r\n\r\n## Helpful resources\r\n* [Simplelink SensorTag](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015)\r\n* [TI E2E Community for Bluetooth Smart](http://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless_connectivity/f/538)\r\n* [IBM IoT Foundation service](https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/device/)\r\n* [IBM Bluemix Doc](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs)\r\n * [Internet of Things Starter](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/IoT/iot500.html)\r\n * [SDK for Node.js](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/nodejs/index.html#nodejs)\r\n* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)  \r\n",
