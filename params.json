Provide several real pictures of your SensorTag and identify all the chips of sensors in the pictures.  \r\nYou can find the following model pictures [here](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/tearDown.html).  \r\n![SensorTag-back](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/images/sensorTag-teardown-bluetooth-03.jpg)\r\n![SensorTag-front](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/images/sensorTag-teardown-bluetooth-04.jpg)\r\n2.  Describe the function and name of the sensor chip you used. You can find the information of the related sensors [here](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/tearDown.html).  \r\n3.  Select an application for the sensor you used. Summary the description, results and potential development plan of your application in a final report, and 1 and 2 as well. \r\n\r\n> i.e., I used the sensor of [TMP007](http://www.ti.com/product/tmp007) to measure the enviroment temperature in the Minhang campus of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  \r\n\r\n## FAQs\r\nTBD","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
